# XPlanner
Planner for Everything.

This is my first iOS app.

I want to make an app for planning, and I can share it with others, synchronize task status through iCloud, and so on.

For now, the functions I want to achieve have been achieved, although not satisfactory, but not satisfactory.ðŸ˜‚

This is my first attempt at swiftUI. It can be used as a reference demo for getting started with swiftUI.

Because I feel that it is not satisfactoryðŸ˜‚, it will not be listed in the App Store for the time being. Wait for some time to optimize and optimizeðŸ˜‚.
